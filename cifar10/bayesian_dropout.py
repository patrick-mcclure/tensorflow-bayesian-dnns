	Outputs the input element multiplied by a random variable sampled from a Bernoulli distribution with either mean keep_prob (scale_during_training False) or mean 1 (scale_during_training True)
	Arguments:
		incoming : A `Tensor`. The incoming tensor.
		keep_prob : A float representing the probability that each element
			is kept.
		scale_during_training : A boolean value determining whether scaling is performed during training or testing
		mc : A boolean Tensor correponding to whether or not Monte-Carlo sampling will be used to calculate the networks output
		name : A name for this layer (optional).
